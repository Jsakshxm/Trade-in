Risk refers to the uncertainty of investment returns, stemming from factors like market volatility and economic conditions. Return, on the other hand, represents the gain or loss on an investment, derived from capital appreciation and dividends. Investors aim for higher returns, but typically, higher returns come with higher risk. Finding the right balance between risk and return is essential for investors, considering their risk tolerance, investment goals, and time horizon."
